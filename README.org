The company I work for, [[http://cardflight.com][CardFlight]], has started a program to sponsor 10% of my
work time for contributing to open source projects.  This repository is to keep
a log of my experience and work.  I am very grateful to have this opportunity,
as Free and Open Source software, documentation, and educational material are
how I gained my knowledge as a programmer in the first place.  Now I am able to
give back to the community through my work!
