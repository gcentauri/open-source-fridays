#+TITLE: First Open Source Friday!

* Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)

I've long been an advocate of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), so
having the opportunity to apply CardFlight's Open Source contribution program
was something I felt very excited about.

I wouldn't have gotten a job at CardFlight without FOSS. I was able to
teach myself how to code by utilizing the work of hundreds of people from
around the globe providing free software, documentation, educational materials.
The book I credit as being the single most important piece of my education
is [[http://htdp.org][How to Design Programs]], which was developed and published freely on the
web, inspired by FOSS principles.

The idea that there is a community of people out there voluntarily giving,
creating and sharing knowledge is very appealing to me. It is a community
that asks for participation. I also felt strongly about the "Free" part
of FOSS. Having the right to use, study, modify, and share software is
empowering.

The opportunity to spend paid time to engage with free and open source
software community is one I did not want to pass up.

* Choosing Where to Contribute

Yet despite my enthusiasm, it took me several months to actually
submit an application. I was holding myself up thinking I had to find the
perfect project. And when I did find an interesting project, sometimes I
would lose confidence in my ability to contribute.

My original entry point into the FOSS world was through digital audio software.
I haven't worked with digital audio in some time, and I miss it, so I thought
I'd try an audio project. After spending some time trying to understand
projects of significant complexity, I ended up feeling demoralized rather
than excited. Picking something so challenging right from the start was
too much of a barrier to overcome. I doubted that I could accomplish much
with 10% of my work time. I didn't apply.

I also considered the [[http://dry-rb.org][dry-rb]] project, a collection
of "next-generation Ruby libraries" intended to help create cleaner code.
I really like the philosophy and what it bringing to the Ruby community.
I never ended up applying for this project either though. I kept feeling
like I wanted something a bit more different than the code I was working
on day-to-day.

Ultimately, the project I chose was something that happened to be right
under my nose. 

* Spacemacs

I chose to contribute to the [[http://spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]] project. In
short, it is a well-tuned "crowd-sourced" configuration for my primary tool:
the venerable text-editor [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]. It offers a way for users to bootstrap into 
powerful editor features without having to configure it all, a challenge in 
itself.

That being said, there is still a learning curve to overcome. I had been
hanging out in the Spacemacs [[https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Gitter
Chat]] to ask questions and soon began to offer help to other users. I
realized that I was already contributing in little ways to the Spacemacs
community. Here's some of the thanks I got from helping in the chat:

I was a teacher before becoming a professional programmer. It is natural for
me to help others learn, and it suddenly became clear to me that there was a
path to being a FOSS contributor right in front of me.

I went to read the contribution guidelines for Spacemacs and found this:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The best way to support Spacemacs is to contribute to it either by reporting 
bugs, helping the community on the Gitter Chat or sending pull requests.
#+END_QUOTE

So without even thinking about it, I had already become a contributor!

* First Friday

** Earning Reputation

After getting approved to work on Spacemacs for my OSS project, I went to the
chat to ask for advice. Should I talk to someone in charge? Or just jump into 
GitHub issues and try my best? The reply I got was this:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
having a track record is indeed the easiest way to gain more power/responsibilities
#+END_QUOTE

So... how to get that? I figured by being present in the chat, I'd at least begun
to establish myself as helpful and interested. I thought I'd spend part of the
day trying to maintain and improve my track record.

*** Helping in the Spacemacs Gitter Chat

So on my first Open Source Friday I decided would hang out in the chat all
day and offer what help I could. I was able to help someone out before lunch:

[[./assets/first-friday/thanks1.png]]

Its a good way to get instant feedback from helping others, however, it
isn't always the most active place. Earlier in the week someone had posted
a question from the [[http://emacs.stack.exchange.com][emacs stack exchange]]
which gave me an idea for another way I could contribute.

*** Signing Up for (e) - Emacs Stack Exchange

The [[http://emacs.stack.exchange.com][emacs stack exchange]] is mentioned as a community resource on the Spacemacs
README. I have ended up there now and then myself when searching to the answer
to an Emacs question.  Someone had posted a
[[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/45982/org-mode-any-way-to-automatically-collapse-blocks-e-g-begin-quote/45984#45984][link to a question about Emacs Org-mode]]
I knew I could answer. I found the reference in the documentation and made
a guest post to answer it. After a moment's thought, I went ahead and created
an account.  Within an hour or so, my answer had been upvoted and accepted.
It has currently earned me +85 reputation points on the stack exchange ;)

[[./assets/first-friday/reputation.png]]

The second accepted answer happened on this first Friday.  I had found another
org related question that had only one single line answer.  I decided to submit
an improved answer with a reference to the documentation again, stepped out to
use the bathoom and had earned another approved answer by the time I got back.

I made a third contribution over the weekend, answering a Spacemacs specific
question. It got interesting because another StackExchange user offered an
alternative answer at about the same time. I looked at it and felt like it
didn't really address the actual question of the original post. Since I had
earned enough reputation points, I had the priviledge of downvoting unhelpful
answers. I felt a bit nervous about doing so because the other user had 25k
reputation points to my 141. But critique is also a part of contributing to
a knowledge base. It cost me one point to downvote the answer, but through 
a series of comments the other poster conceded that they had misunderstood
the question and deleted their answer. I got my reputation point back ;).

All this goes to show that you can make meaningful contributions to
other members of the community without a single pull request.

** Addressing Open Issues

Meanwhile, I decided to get started on one of the 2000+ issues on the 
Spacemacs GitHub. I found one [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/11569][bug report]] that hadn't been confirmed yet,
and decided I could get started by simply trying to reproduce it. But
before that, I had to check out the latest version of development code.

*** Setting Up Separate Spacemacs for Development

It is a bit strange to try and switch to the develop branch on the software you
use to edit code day-to-day!  So I decided to clone a new copy of the Spacemacs
configuration so that I can have a way to start fresh without impacting my
usual development environment.

- created a directory =spacemacs-dev/=
- cloned spacemacs into =.emacs.d/= within that directory
- switched branch to =develop=
- create bash script to launch emacs with =env= setting HOME to =spacemacs-dev/=

On MacOS the launcher script looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #!/bin/bash

  env HOME=/Users/gshang/spacemacs-dev/ open /Applications/Emacs.app/ -n
#+END_SRC

The =-n= flag to the =open= command opens a new instance of the app if one is
already running

*** Is It a Bug, or Not?

After I got a development version of Spacemacs up and running, I tried to
reproduce the bug from a clean slate. It didn't happen. So, I installed all the
additional packages from the bug report and tried again. Everything still worked
as expected. I was slightly disappointed, but this sort of triage is still
important when trying to solve an issue. I ended up posting a comment on 
the ticket reporting that I could not reproduce the bug, and made reference
to the commit I tested against. The original reporter commented later that
while a different related issue has been solved by cleaning out his own
installation, this bug still persists. The issue remains open.

** Conclusion

While I didn't make any earth-shattering contributions on my first day, I have
to say it felt very good. I was able to focus in on something I want to learn
more about, offer help to others, and get started on the path to contributing
actual code. A big part of the process is simply engagement with the community.
Software is really about people, not computers and code, and I have begun to
earn some positive reputation in the FOSS world.
